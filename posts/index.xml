      <description>There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be anything exceptionally difficult about differentiating with respect to symmetric matrices.
Differentiation is defined over abstract spaces. And the set of real symmetric matrices $\mathbb{S}_n(\mathbb{R})$ is not special. And yet, this past semester, Paul and I, along with a student, Aleksandr, ran into problems.
It turns out that this problem of computing gradients with respect to a symmetric matrix is common enough that several confusing threads on mathoverflow on the topic exist.</description>
